    "# List Datatype in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are fundamental data structures in Python used to store collections of items in an ordered and changeable way. They are versatile and can hold elements of various data types (integers, strings, floats, booleans, or even other lists) within the same list.  \n",
    "Lists are defined using square brackets [ ], and the items within a list can be of different data type\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key characteristics and features of lists in Python:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Mutable__: Lists are mutable, meaning that you can modify their elements after they have been created. You can change, add, or remove elements from a list as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Ordered__: Lists maintain the order of elements as they are inserted. This means that the position of each element in the list is fixed and preserved. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Indexing and Slicing__: Elements in a list can be accessed using indexing and slicing. Indexing starts from 0 for the first element and continues sequentially. Slicing allows you to extract a subset of elements from a list by specifying a range of indices. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Dynamic Size__: Lists in Python can dynamically grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed. There is no need to specify the size of a list when it is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Mixed Data Types__: Lists can contain elements of different data types. This flexibility allows you to store heterogeneous data in a single list. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Iterable__: Lists are iterable, meaning that you can iterate over their elements using loops or list comprehension. "
